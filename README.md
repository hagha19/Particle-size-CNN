# Implementing 1D CNN regression for particle size determination 

The particle size of lake sediments integrates important environmental information, and the detection of changes in this variable over time provides important information for understanding ecosystem and sedimentary processes. This code develops and applies a new methodology based on a 1D convolutional autoencoder as the feature extractor and a 1D CNN architecture for regression. The proposed architecture was applied to hyperspectral images of nine lake sediment cores across Canada.
